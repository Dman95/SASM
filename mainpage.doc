/*! \mainpage SASM Development Documentation
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Below you will find what and where to modify appropriate header and source files when you want to add a feature. 
 *
 * \section Commenting
 * 
 * When commenting use doxygen's syntax. Place the comment above the intended line. After adding the feature, run 
 * doxygen.exe configfile to update the documentation. Be sure to double check the documentation to ensure the 
 * added comments were parsed  correctly.
 *
 * \section Adding Assembler Support
 *
 * Adding support is a relatively straight forward process. Each supported assembler is a derived Assembler and
 * has its own header and cpp file.  
 * 
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Creating the header and cpp 
 * 
 * The first step is to create the new header and cpp file for the assembler. These should be named all lowercase without gaps
 *
 * \subsection step2 Step 2: Creating the assembler class
 *
 * The decleration of the class may best be discussed in light of already supported assemblers. Take for example, NASM. The NASM 
 * class is defined as: 
 * class NASM : public Assembler 
 *
 * The generic definition is
 * class YOURASSEMBLER : public Assembler
 * 
 * The variables and methods of YOURASSEMBLER should be the virtual methods of Assembler. If you are unsure what to add, refer to 
 * the already supported assemler classes. You may copy and paste them.
 *
 * \subsection step3 Step 3: Adding it to the Build Options
 *
 * You should hopefully know enough QT to be able to add form controls. The code for modifying the build menu can be found in
 * mainwindow.cpp. Refer to its documentation for more reference on where to add/modify code.
 *
 *
 * \section Adding Language Support
 *
 * \subsection Form Text
 *.
 * All of the labels must be 
 *
 * \subsection Help File
 *
 * The help file, __.xxx, needs to be translated and saved into a new xx.xxx file. The 
 * void MainWindow::openHelp()
 * must be modified to support the added language. This is done by adding another if statement. 
 * 
 * \subsection startText
 *
 * The default assembler skeleton needs to have its comments translated. This can be done by  
 * etc...
